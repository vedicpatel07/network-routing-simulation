# Network Routing Simulation

A simulation of packets in a network of routers using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Files

- `network_core.py`: Contains the core routing algorithm implementation and network logic
- `network_visualization.py`: Handles visualization and animation of the network routing process

## Requirements
```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib numpy
```
